<h1>Route.IO</h1>
<p>Route links events and commands on your network-aware devices. Through an ever-expanding set of modules, this allows you to do things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn your lights on from your phone</li>
  <li>Use voice commands to change the TV station</li>
  <li>Play music on your stereo from your Kindle</li>
  <li>Turn your projector from your light switches</li>
  <li>Change the color of your lights depending on the weather</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, a moderate level of computer knowledge is needed to set up Route (it's configured through JavaScript), and the list of supported hardware is still growing. If that still sounds OK, you should grab <a href="https://github.com/glenmurphy/route/">the source code</a>, look through <a href="https://github.com/glenmurphy/route/blob/master/examples/emerson/emerson.js">an example</a>, and <a href="mailto:glen@glenmurphy.com">get in contact</a>.</p>
